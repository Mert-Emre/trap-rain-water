In this project we are given some input files which contains wall heights. Program will ask you to modify the map. Inputs should be in the form of a1 or b2 etc. When the modification is done, it will calculate the squre root of the total volume of water that can be trapped inside the walls. It will also print the map with lake names. Lakes are created by contiguous water tiles. Walls leak water in diagonal direction. If you want to change the input file, change the line 8 of the Main.java.
